# TLS_malware_detection
TLS malware detetion using machine learning (for my project in class :)) ). This the source is base from https://github.com/WalterDiong/TLS-Malware-Detection-with-Machine-Learning, (its just a copycat), but I edit some part so that it is more clearly, understandable.

### Usage:
-   Dataset: you should visit [this](https://github.com/WalterDiong/TLS-Malware-Detection-with-Machine-Learning) for more information about how to get the dataset. Remember to install cisco/joy for fearture extracting from pcap to. json file.
-   TLS_flow_extract_and_labeling: use this for extracting features from .json file (convert to .csv for training or validating)
    -   benign_url_file: contain top most visited websitre domain, it is use to check if the server domain name is come from top 1000000. If it is, then it's trustable, otherwise sus. So don't worry about it . If you want to use most update data, then go to this link: https://majestic.com/reports/majestic-million , download the csv and replace the benign_url_filename
    -   benign_path : replace to your benign folder which contain benign pcap file (the output file name will be benign_flows.csv)
    -   malicious_path : same as benign path, but the folder contain malware pcap file (the output file name will be malicious_flows.csv)
-   training: replace malicious_filename and benign_filename with corresponding dataset filename for training data (you can use my sample dataset for training or just use your own dataset, which is highly recommend for accuracy), the valididation_filename is for scoring, so you don't need to actually worry about it.
-   load_model: replace malicious and benign with corresponding dataset filename for scoring, let it == "" if you don't want to load it.
